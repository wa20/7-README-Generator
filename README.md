  ## Description

  When creating an open source project on GitHub, itâ€™s important to have a high-quality README for the app. I want to quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.

## Installation
To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:
npm install

## Usage
First ensure that you have node.js and npm installed on your devcie. Then open up the comand line terminal and navigate to the location of app.js. Once there type 'node app.js', this will then prompt you with questions to create and populate the README file for you.

## Tests
To run tests, run the following command:
```
npm test
```

## Collaborators
